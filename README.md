# Comparing Wordle Word Lists

Some have said that NYT changed Josh Wardle's original Wordle wordlist, but this is (for the most part) not true.

### Few changes:

These words were removed from the sequence of answers:

> agora, pupal, wench, lynch, slave, fibre

These words were moved to the very end of the answers list:

> bobby, eclat, fella, gaily, harry, hasty, hydro, liege, octal, ombre, payer, sooth, unset, unlit, vomit, fanny, fetus, butch, stalk, flack, widow, augur

These words became guessable:

> koran, quran
